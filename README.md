# Acan
Modular stream recorder and video downloader that supports Twitch, Kick and Youtube
Records live streams including Chat from Twitch, Kick and Youtbue. Also downloads available Clips and VODs.
Archive entire Youtube channels.

Currently heavily WIP.
Parallel monitoring needs more optimization, kick chat and clips dont work atm, twitch should work as intended, youtube livestreams and videos do work, chat is on the list


Installation & Usage:
git clone https://github.com/Beerman-pixel/Acan.git
cd Acan/
pip3 install requirements.txt

Set output paths, quality and channels to monitor in config.yaml, then run main.py
